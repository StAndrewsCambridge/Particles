        <h3>This interactive platform allows you to explore the behavior 
            of ideal gases in various conditions. Ideal gases are substances 
            exhibiting predictable relationships between pressure, volume, and 
            temperature. Through our simulation, you can observe how these gases 
            behave under different scenarios, gaining insights into their properties 
            and applications in the real world. Dive into our simulation by navigating 
            to Simulation and discover the behaviors of ideal gases.</h3>
