            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Created in the early 17th century, the gas laws have been around to assist 
                scientists in finding volumes, amount, pressures and temperature when coming 
                to matters of gas. The gas laws consist of three primary laws: Charles' Law, 
                Boyle's Law and Avogadro's Law (all of which will later combine into the General 
                Gas Equation and Ideal Gas Law).</p>
            <p>The three fundamental gas laws discover the relationship of pressure, 
                temperature, volume and amount of gas. Boyle's Law tells us that the volume 
                of gas increases as the pressure decreases. Charles' Law tells us that the 
                volume of gas increases as the temperature increases. And Avogadro's Law tell 
                us that the volume of gas increases as the amount of gas increases. The ideal 
                gas law is the combination of the three simple gas laws. </p>

            <h2>Boyle's Law</h2>
            <p>In 1662, Robert Boyle discovered the correlation between Pressure 
                (P)and Volume (V) (assuming Temperature(T) and Amount of Gas(n) remain constant):</p>

            <h4>P∝1/V → PV=x</h4>

            <p> where x is a constant depending on amount of gas at a given temperature.
                Pressure is inversely proportional to Volume, which can be seen in the graph 
                of pressure against volume. Please drag the slider to see the graph appear.</p>

                In 1787, French physicists Jacques Charles, discovered the correlation between

            <p>where y is a constant depending on amount of gas and pressure. 
                Volume is directly proportional to Temperature. This relationship 
                can be seen from the graph of volume against temperature. </p>

            <h2> Conclusion</h2>
            <p> 
                The ideal gas law is the combination of the three simple gas laws. 
                By setting all three laws directly or inversely proportional to Volume, you get:
            </p>        

            <h4> V∝nTP </h4>
            <p>
                Next replacing the directly proportional to sign with a constant(R) you get:
            </p>
            <h4>V=RnTP</h4>
            <p>
                And finally get the equation:
